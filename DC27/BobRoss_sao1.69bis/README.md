# Bob Ross Happy Trees SAO #

Happy little SAOs. 

What does this SAO do? Nothing. Other than properly frame another SAO. A hole has been added for zip ties or other method to secure to your favorite badge. 

We shared this on OSHPark for easy manufacturing, however, it looks better if the Soldermask is a light color and Silk Screen is black. [https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/z3rmx0di]
